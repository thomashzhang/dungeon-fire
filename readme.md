## Dungeon Fire: Castle Defense

Defend against waves of orcs, trolls and other attackers. Upgrade your castle defenses with rubies. Hire mercenaries with gems.

## Contributing

It's very simple, there's no roadmap, just good coding and open source license  assets. Feel free to make a PR for any of the issues on github. If there's no existing issue for a feature you'd like to see in the game, please create a new issue and subsequently a PR. I will be the sole PR reviewer.
